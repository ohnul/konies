Comprehensive style guidelines and agent instructions for the collaborative novel writing project.

## Style Guidelines

### Target Audience
- Primary readers: Upper elementary to middle school students (Harry Potter Book 1 reading level)
- Age range: Those who can comfortably read Harry Potter

### Narrative Perspective and Tense
- **Point of view**: Third-person omniscient
- **Tense**: Past tense with "-했다" endings in Korean
- **Example**: "지훈은 하늘을 올려다보았다." (Ji-hoon looked up at the sky.)

### Writing Style
- **Sentence structure**: Keep sentences relatively short while varying structure for rhythm
- **Tone**: Soft and comfortable writing style, warm and humorous without cruel descriptions
- **Balance**:
  - Adventure and tension: 60%

- **Elements to include**:
  - Character interactions and situational humor
  - Balance of action, dialogue, and description
  - Sensory details to make scenes vivid
  - Use all five senses with child-appropriate metaphors

### Descriptive Approach
- Be descriptive but follow with explanations to aid understanding
- **Example**:
  > 첫 입을 베어 물자 달콤한 맛이 혀끝에 번지며 그녀의 입가에 미소가 번졌다. 케이크를 씹을 때마다 어깨가 들썩이고, 작은 콧노래가 흘러나왔다. 접시 위의 마지막 딸기 조각을 포크로 집어 들며 수진의 얼굴은 환하게 빛났다. 누가 보아도 수진이 기뻐하는 것을 알 수 있었다.
  >
  > (As she took the first bite, sweetness spread across her tongue and a smile bloomed on her lips. Her shoulders bounced with each chew, and a small hum escaped. Sujin's face brightened as she picked up the last strawberry piece with her fork. Anyone could see that Sujin was happy.)

### Content Guidelines
- **Prohibited content**: No cruel or violent descriptions suitable for children's literature
- **Fear elements**: Keep horror at tension level only, not actual fear
