## Improvement Patterns
- Chapters: 53->88 (+35), consistent across both
- Scenes: 57->83 (+26), smaller gain due to higher start and stricter "집필 가능" requirements
- Scene ceiling appears lower (~83-85) vs Chapter ceiling (~88) due to concreteness bar
- Team feedback absorption: mandatory 100%, recommended ~86%

## Scene Document Quality Patterns

### 01-02-01-scene 2nd Eval Key Findings
- Chapter-to-Scene specificity DROP resolved in 4/5 areas. 인지부하 only partial.
- All 5 categories at 80%+ (balanced). E항목: 47%->80% most dramatic.
- E-3(정합성): 0->3, D-1(전환): 1->3, D-3(감각): 1->3 -- all full marks after revision
- D-4(유머): 2/2 both times. Most stable strength.
- C-5(동선): 1->1. Physical details still vague. D-6(페이싱): 1->1. Beat-level density missing.

### Sensory Integration: Key Editorial Contribution
- My defining feedback: "감각 묘사가 별도 섹션에 분리되어 비트 안에 녹아들지 않았다"
- Resolved with [감각:] tags inside beats. Pattern established for future Scene docs.
- Transition points need sensory CHANGES (not just new keywords). M2->M3 wind change = exemplary.
- Chapter=keyword tables, Scene=sentences in beats, Transitions=sensory changes

### Dialogue Quality Patterns
- 민준: Strongest voice. "썸네일이 안 되잖아!" is model (캐릭터+서사 dual function).
- 수진: Weakest differentiation. Needs "체계적 사고" vocabulary, not generic lines.
- 지훈: "수학 숙제가 밀렸다" IS 지훈 (no social filter, concrete facts). Don't over-correct.
- Rule: 민준=instant ID, 지훈=mostly ID, 수진=sometimes generic -- prioritize 수진 fixes.

### S-grade Remaining Items
- C-2: 지훈/수진 대사 톤 (자연어 vs 체계어)
- D-5: 연령 적합성 가이드 (보류, 공포 씬 우선)
- D-6: 비트 단위 밀도 지시
- E-2: 끝 상황 "번쩍임" 다음 씬 연결
- C-5: 물리적 디테일 (삼각대 위치 등)

## Scoring Calibration
- 01-act: 83, 01-01-ch: 88, 01-02-ch: 88, 01-02-01-sc: 57->83
- Scene starts ~55-57, ends ~83. Chapter starts ~53, ends ~88.
- Scene docs have lower ceiling due to "집필 가능 수준" concreteness requirements.

## Recurring Issues to Track
- **"스스로" typo**: 04-act.md, 01-02-chapter.md
- **"석등 길" vs "연쇄 석등"**: setting-overview vs chapter gap
- **"마을 빚 50억"**: Unresolved in setting-overview.md
- **끝 상황 "번쩍임"**: 01-02-01에서 설치, 01-02-02에서 연결 미확인

## Evaluation Criteria Patterns
- A-3/B-2/D-1: Beat/Moment triple overlap risk at Scene level (boundaries blur)
- D-5 covers two areas (공포 + 어휘) in only 2 points
- "전환 트리거" used heavily but undefined in any document
- Scene "구체화 허용" in 설정 충돌 해결 (new vs Chapter)

## Feedback Style
- Re-evaluation: Before/After comparison table first
- "Chapter 대비 구체성 역전" table is effective diagnostic
- Always include "편집작가 특별 소견" with practical writing advice
- Provide specific alternative dialogue examples for 대사 톤 changes
- Acknowledge feedback absorption explicitly with counts

## Novel Review Patterns (novel-01-02-01, first review)

### Scene-to-Novel Conversion Issues
- [감각:] tags from scene docs get "dumped" as consecutive description blocks (line 7 problem)
- Fix: distribute sensory details across beats, interleave with action/dialogue
- Scene doc pacing notes ("대사 사이에 묘사 삽입") not fully realized in novel prose
- Transition triggers become "explained" instead of "shown" -- need action-based transitions

### Recurring Novel-Level Problems
- "뒤를 돌아보다" repeated 3x (lines 11, 105, 129) -- same anxiety gesture overused
- "안도" emotion stated 3x -- once early, once mid, once late. 2x is max.
- Sensory detail contradiction: line 113 "포장된 마을 길" vs line 145 "부드러운 흙"
- tell-not-show pattern: lines 35, 47, 93 (emotional state named instead of shown)

### Character Voice in Novel
- 민준: Strongest. "썸네일이 안 되잖아!" confirmed as model dialogue in novel form too.
- 지훈: Good overall but line 99 duplicates 수진's direction. Needs unique angle per scene doc.
- 수진: Internal thoughts over-explained by narrator (lines 35, 41). Better to show via action.
- Pattern: novelist tends to use narrator explanation for 수진's processing, action for 민준.

### Novel Scoring Calibration
- novel-01-02-01: B+ (first novel file reviewed)
- 5 mandatory fixes, 9 recommended fixes = 14 total suggestions
- Strongest section: M2 (촬영 소동) -- comic rhythm well executed
- Weakest section: M1 (추리 구간) -- insufficient breathing space between interpretations

### Scene Doc Fidelity Check
- Beat coverage: 100% (all beats from scene doc present)
- Added content: mostly good (지훈 "돌은 만져봐야", 겨울이 loyalty detail)
- Weakened content: M1-B3 "미완성 원형" tension, M3-B1 지훈 differentiation
- Contradictions: spatial description (포장 vs 흙길), none in character/plot

## Novel Editing Patterns (First Direct Edit: novel-01-02-01)

### What Worked Well in Direct Editing
- Mandatory fixes were straightforward: spatial contradictions, dialogue differentiation, tell->show
- Condensing narrator explanation (41행 과잉 설명 제거) improved flow immediately
- Merging split-action sequences (93-97행 리더 모드 2단계->1단계) tightened pacing
- Adding breathing-space descriptions in M1 (lines 41, 35) improved reader participation rhythm

### Editing Decisions Log
- Removed middle "안도" check (105-109행 삭제), kept first (11행) and last (125행) = 3->2
- Removed "뒤를 돌아보다" 3rd instance (129행), kept 1st (11행) and 2nd (101행 "교실 건물 쪽은 조용했다"로 간접 표현) = 3->1.5
- "시간이 흐르고 있었다" tell sentence removed -- shadow description already conveys this
- 119행 "아직 불안이 완전히 사라진 것은 아니었다" -> condensed to fragment style for better rhythm
- 109행 "걱정이 고개를 들었다" cliche -> "가슴이 두근거리는 것이 설렘 때문인지, 불안 때문인지" (more 수진-specific)

### Pitfalls to Watch in Future Edits
- When removing middle安도 check, need transition sentence for 지훈's 수학 숙제 대사 context
- Condensing two 수진 대사 into one paragraph risks wall-of-text; broke with action between
- Adding M1 breathing descriptions must stay SHORT (1-2 sentences max) to not slow pacing further
- Fragment sentences ("~모르겠지만.") work for emotional beats but should be used sparingly
