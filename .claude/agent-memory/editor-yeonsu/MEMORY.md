# Editor Yeonsu - Agent Memory

## Project Status
- Act evaluation criteria document reviewed twice (2026-02-07)
- First review: rated B+, 11 suggestions made, 10 accepted
- Second review: rated A, 2 minor suggestions remaining (D-6 배점 조정, 평가 결과 기록 위치)
- 01-act.md evaluated (2026-02-07): rated D (57/100), 11 improvement recommendations
- 01-act.md re-evaluated (2026-02-08): rated A (83/100), +26 improvement. 5 S-grade suggestions remaining

## Document Review Patterns
- `act/act-evaluation-criteria.md`: 436-line evaluation criteria document, well-structured with 5 pillars (A~E), scoring system (100pt), and cross-evaluation appendix
- Team feedback cycle: 3 reviewers (이연수/편집, 조혜원/플롯, 박호진/집필) -> 팀장 반영 -> 2차 리뷰
- 김태수 팀장 responds to feedback with clear accept/reject reasoning

## Act Document Quality Patterns
- **01-act.md quality gap RESOLVED**: After revision, 01-act.md (83pt) now matches 02-act.md (84pt example) quality
- **01-act.md now has sections other Acts lack**: Growth arc starting points, humor element design, time frame details
- **Common weakness across Acts**: C-6 캐릭터 상호작용 설계 is weak in both 01-act.md and 02-act.md
- **D-6 독자 경험 설계**: Anchor scene designation is missing across most Act docs
- **NOTE-TO-AI annotations**: 01-act.md has 2 팀장 annotations with unresolved questions about 복선 design
- **"불꽃 도령" setting conflict RESOLVED**: Now present in setting-overview.md (line 63)
- **"마을 빚 50억" NEW setting conflict**: Specific amount in 01-act.md not in setting-overview.md
- **Scene count discrepancy RESOLVED**: 팀장 ruled plot-structure.md scenes are "examples", Act doc is authoritative

## 01-act.md Revision Assessment (2026-02-08)
Key improvements from D->A:
1. Character balance: All 6 characters now have specific roles (was only 수진)
2. Growth arc starting points: 5 characters mapped to character-overview.md themes exactly
3. Tone design: Age-appropriate guide added ("절망보다는 슬픔과 막막함")
4. Humor design: 4 comedy patterns designed (matches CLAUDE.md patterns)
5. Structural completeness: 공간 동선, 시간 프레임, 감정 아크 7단계 all added
6. 복선 section added with 4 foreshadowing elements (though some disputed by 팀장)

Remaining for S-grade: C-6 상호작용 설계, D-6 앵커 장면, E-4 "50억" 공식화, D-5 이완 구간, E-6 복선 확정

## Key Editorial Observations
- "스스로" spelling issue: appears in 04-act.md (line 8, 51). May be typo for "스스로"
- Prologue/Epilogue formatting exceptions now documented in criteria
- Cross-evaluation (횡단 평가) relationship to individual scoring now clarified
- Setting conflict resolution rule: Act docs cannot independently create rules not in parent docs

## Feedback Style Notes
- Re-evaluation should: compare before/after, acknowledge improvements, focus on remaining gaps
- When scoring re-evaluation, be fair to genuine improvements - don't hold back points
- Always verify cross-document consistency (character-overview, setting-overview, plot-structure)
- Note difference between "NOTE-TO-AI annotations" vs "document body" information
- Other Act docs for comparison: 02-act ~84pt, 03-act ~80-83pt estimated, 04-act ~80pt estimated
- For Act evaluations: always compare against other Act documents for quality consistency
- Use concrete examples from the evaluated document when pointing out issues
