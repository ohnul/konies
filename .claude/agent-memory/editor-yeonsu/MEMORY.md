# Editor Yeonsu - Agent Memory

## Project Status
- Act evaluation criteria document reviewed twice (2026-02-07)
- Chapter evaluation criteria reviewed (2026-02-08): rated A-, 11 suggestions made
- 01-act.md: D(57) -> A(83), +26
- 01-01-chapter.md: D(53) -> A(88), +35. All 13 items reflected.
- **01-02-chapter.md: D(53) -> A(88), +35. All 13 items reflected. (2026-02-09)**

## Improvement Pattern: D->A (+35) is Consistent
- 01-01: 53->88, 01-02: 53->88. Same start, same end.
- Both achieved identical category scores (A:22, B:22, C:17, D:14, E:13)
- Suggests systematic learning transfer from 01-01 revision to 01-02 revision
- Team's feedback absorption rate: 100% (13/13 items in both cases)

## Chapter Document Quality Patterns

### 01-01-chapter Key Innovation
- 5-moment structure for single-scene chapters
- Solved "single scene overload" problem

### 01-02-chapter Key Innovation
- D항목: 6->14 (+8), most dramatic. Was at 40% threshold, now 93%
- Humor (D-4): 0->2. 5 comedy patterns with dual function (이완+서사)
- Tension/release: ASCII graph + 5 이완 구간 + 6 전환 트리거 (exceeds 01-01's 4)
- Mini-climax: 3-stage chain (민준 idea -> 지훈 discovery -> 수진 synthesis)
- "연꽃 문양" -> "꽃받침 형태 받침": Critical setting fix completed
- Remaining for S-grade: D-5 씬3 감각(후각), E-4 "석등 길" 용어 통일

### General Chapter Patterns
- D항목 consistently weakest initially, then most improved
- B-3 서브플롯 systematically weak at first pass
- D-5 감각: 미각 absent across both chapters; transition scenes get less sensory detail
- **Quality gap between 01-01 and 01-02 NOW RESOLVED**: Both at 88
- Moment structure for single-scene, scene-level detail for multi-scene chapters

## Recurring Issues to Track
- **"스스로" typo**: 04-act.md (line 8, 51), 01-02-chapter.md (~line 210)
- **"석등 길" vs "연쇄 석등"**: setting-overview vs chapter terminology gap
- **"마을 빚 50억"**: Unresolved in setting-overview.md (팀장: "별도 작업")

## Scoring Calibration
- 01-act: 83/100 (A)
- 01-01-chapter: 88/100 (A)
- 01-02-chapter: 88/100 (A)
- Quality: 01-01 = 01-02 (88) > 01-act (83). Chapters more detailed than Act, as expected.

## Feedback Style
- Re-evaluation: Before/After table first, then detailed scoring
- Acknowledge complete feedback absorption explicitly
- Cross-document consistency checks are critical (character-overview, setting-overview, Act NOTE-TO-AI)
- When sibling chapters match quality, note the balance explicitly
- Chapter doc's core role: translate Act design into scene-level actionable guidance
