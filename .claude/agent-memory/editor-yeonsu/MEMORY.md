# Editor Yeonsu - Agent Memory

## Project Status
- Act evaluation criteria document reviewed twice (2026-02-07)
- First review: rated B+, 11 suggestions made, 10 accepted
- Second review: rated A, 2 minor suggestions remaining (D-6 배점 조정, 평가 결과 기록 위치)
- 01-act.md evaluated (2026-02-07): rated D (57/100), 11 improvement recommendations

## Document Review Patterns
- `act/act-evaluation-criteria.md`: 430-line evaluation criteria document, well-structured with 5 pillars (A~E), scoring system (100pt), and cross-evaluation appendix
- Team feedback cycle: 3 reviewers (이연수/편집, 조혜원/플롯, 박호진/집필) -> 팀장 반영 -> 2차 리뷰
- 김태수 팀장 responds to feedback with clear accept/reject reasoning

## Act Document Quality Patterns
- **01-act.md is significantly less detailed than 02~04-act.md**: Core issue is information density gap, not direction
- **Common missing sections across Acts**: 공간 동선 요약 and 시간 프레임 missing from 01-act.md and partially from 02-act.md
- **Character action specificity varies**: 02-act.md has 7 characters with specific actions; 01-act.md has only 1 (수진)
- **Tone ratio missing from 01-act.md**: All other acts specify adventure/friendship percentage ratios
- **"불꽃 도령" setting conflict**: Appears in 01-act.md and 04-act.md but not in setting-overview.md - needs 팀장 resolution per E-4 rule
- **Scene count discrepancy**: 01-act.md lists 1 scene for Ch.1, but plot-structure.md lists 3 scenes
- **Growth arc starting points**: 01-act.md completely misses C-4 - critical for Act 1 which should set character baselines

## Key Editorial Observations
- "스스로" spelling issue flagged in 1st review - 팀장 claims correct, may be encoding issue. Also appears in 04-act.md.
- Prologue/Epilogue formatting exceptions now documented in criteria
- Cross-evaluation (횡단 평가) relationship to individual scoring now clarified
- Setting conflict resolution rule established: Act docs cannot independently create rules not in parent docs
- 횡단-2 shows 지영/태호 as "주요" in Act 1, but 01-act.md doesn't reflect their concrete actions

## Feedback Style Notes
- 2nd review should be shorter than 1st - focus on reflection quality, not re-raising resolved issues
- When proposals are partially accepted, evaluate whether integration achieves original intent
- For Act evaluations: always compare against other Act documents for quality consistency
- Use concrete examples from the evaluated document when pointing out issues
- Distinguish "문서의 질 vs 문서의 양" - 01-act had good direction but insufficient content
