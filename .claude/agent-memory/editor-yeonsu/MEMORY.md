# Editor Yeonsu - Agent Memory

## Project Status
- Act evaluation criteria document reviewed twice (2026-02-07)
- First review: rated B+, 11 suggestions made, 10 accepted
- Second review: rated A, 2 minor suggestions remaining (D-6 배점 조정, 평가 결과 기록 위치)

## Document Review Patterns
- `act/act-evaluation-criteria.md`: 430-line evaluation criteria document, well-structured with 5 pillars (A~E), scoring system (100pt), and cross-evaluation appendix
- Team feedback cycle: 3 reviewers (이연수/편집, 조혜원/플롯, 박호진/집필) -> 팀장 반영 -> 2차 리뷰
- 김태수 팀장 responds to feedback with clear accept/reject reasoning

## Key Editorial Observations
- "스스로" spelling issue flagged in 1st review - 팀장 claims correct, may be encoding issue. Needs byte-level verification.
- Prologue/Epilogue formatting exceptions now documented in criteria
- Cross-evaluation (횡단 평가) relationship to individual scoring now clarified
- Setting conflict resolution rule established: Act docs cannot independently create rules not in parent docs

## Feedback Style Notes
- 2nd review should be shorter than 1st - focus on reflection quality, not re-raising resolved issues
- When proposals are partially accepted (e.g., D-6 integrated into existing section instead of new F section), evaluate whether the integration achieves the original intent
- Note both well-reflected and inadequately-reflected items separately
