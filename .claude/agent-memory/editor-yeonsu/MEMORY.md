# Editor Yeonsu - Agent Memory

## Project Status
- Act evaluation criteria document reviewed twice (2026-02-07)
- Chapter evaluation criteria reviewed (2026-02-08): rated A-, 11 suggestions made
- **Scene evaluation criteria reviewed (2026-02-09): rated A-, 14 suggestions made**
- 01-act.md: D(57) -> A(83), +26
- 01-01-chapter.md: D(53) -> A(88), +35. All 13 items reflected.
- **01-02-chapter.md: D(53) -> A(88), +35. All 13 items reflected. (2026-02-09)**

## Improvement Pattern: D->A (+35) is Consistent
- 01-01: 53->88, 01-02: 53->88. Same start, same end.
- Both achieved identical category scores (A:22, B:22, C:17, D:14, E:13)
- Suggests systematic learning transfer from 01-01 revision to 01-02 revision
- Team's feedback absorption rate: 100% (13/13 items in both cases)

## Chapter Document Quality Patterns

### 01-01-chapter Key Innovation
- 5-moment structure for single-scene chapters
- Solved "single scene overload" problem

### 01-02-chapter Key Innovation
- D항목: 6->14 (+8), most dramatic. Was at 40% threshold, now 93%
- Humor (D-4): 0->2. 5 comedy patterns with dual function (이완+서사)
- Tension/release: ASCII graph + 5 이완 구간 + 6 전환 트리거 (exceeds 01-01's 4)
- Mini-climax: 3-stage chain (민준 idea -> 지훈 discovery -> 수진 synthesis)
- "연꽃 문양" -> "꽃받침 형태 받침": Critical setting fix completed
- Remaining for S-grade: D-5 씬3 감각(후각), E-4 "석등 길" 용어 통일

### General Chapter Patterns
- D항목 consistently weakest initially, then most improved
- B-3 서브플롯 systematically weak at first pass
- D-5 감각: 미각 absent across both chapters; transition scenes get less sensory detail
- **Quality gap between 01-01 and 01-02 NOW RESOLVED**: Both at 88
- Moment structure for single-scene, scene-level detail for multi-scene chapters

## Recurring Issues to Track
- **"스스로" typo**: 04-act.md (line 8, 51), 01-02-chapter.md (~line 210)
- **"석등 길" vs "연쇄 석등"**: setting-overview vs chapter terminology gap
- **"마을 빚 50억"**: Unresolved in setting-overview.md (팀장: "별도 작업")

## Scoring Calibration
- 01-act: 83/100 (A)
- 01-01-chapter: 88/100 (A)
- 01-02-chapter: 88/100 (A)
- Quality: 01-01 = 01-02 (88) > 01-act (83). Chapters more detailed than Act, as expected.

## Feedback Style
- Re-evaluation: Before/After table first, then detailed scoring
- Acknowledge complete feedback absorption explicitly
- Cross-document consistency checks are critical (character-overview, setting-overview, Act NOTE-TO-AI)
- When sibling chapters match quality, note the balance explicitly
- Chapter doc's core role: translate Act design into scene-level actionable guidance

## Evaluation Criteria Review Patterns (Act->Chapter->Scene)

### Recurring Structural Issue: Item Overlap
- **Act**: No overlap issues initially
- **Chapter**: A-3/B-4 mini-climax overlap, B-1/E-3 role overlap -> resolved in v2
- **Scene**: A-3/B-2/D-1 Beat/Moment triple overlap -> my key feedback item #1
- Pattern: Each level adds complexity in "absorbed unit" evaluation, causing overlap risk

### Scene Criteria Key Findings
- A-3/B-2/D-1 evaluate Beat/Moment from three angles but boundaries blur in practice
- D-3 "묘사 문장 수준" lacks concrete example (키워드 vs 묘사 문장 비교 needed)
- D-5 "연령 적합성" covers two distinct areas (공포/긴장 + 어휘) in only 2 points
- D-1, D-2, D-6 lack 배점 스케일 앵커 (D-3, A-1, A-2, A-3, B-2, C-2 have them)
- Example scoring: A-3 감점 사유 contains B-2 content (감정 변화 단조); D-6 0점 is harsh
- "연꽃 문양" setting conflict appears in BOTH Chapter and Scene examples
- "전환 트리거" term used heavily in Scene but undefined in any document
- S등급: Act/Chapter="출판 준비 완료", Scene="집필 준비 완료" (appropriate change)
- Scene adds "구체화 허용" in 설정 충돌 해결 규칙 (new, appropriate)
- Appendix: 6 balance items (Chapter had 5), added "시간 연속성" (균형-6)
- 97행: "B-2와 D-2" possibly should be "B-2와 D-1" (D-2=긴장/이완 리듬, not 분위기 전환)

### Three-Tier Evaluation Criteria Comparison
- Act: 11 필수 섹션, 5 평가 항목, 5 횡단 평가
- Chapter: 11 필수 섹션, 5 평가 항목, 5 균형 점검
- Scene: 11 필수 섹션, 5 평가 항목, 6 균형 점검
- All share: 25/25/20/15/15 배점, S/A/B/C/D 등급, B등급 합격, 40% 최소
