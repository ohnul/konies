# Novel Writer Park - Agent Memory

## Project Structure
- Pipeline: `act/` -> `chapter/` -> `scene/` -> `novel/` -> `final/`
- Numbering: Act(sequential), Chapter(absolute), Scene(relative within chapter)
- Existing novel files: novel-00-00-01, novel-00-00-02, novel-01-01-01, novel-01-02-01 (multiple versions)

## Key Insights from Act Evaluation Review (2026-02-07)
- Act documents serve as top-level guides; their quality directly impacts novel prose quality
- Most useful Act-level info for writing: emotional arc, tone ratios, character crisis responses
- Missing from current Act docs: sensory keywords, spatial movement paths, internal time progression
- Scene docs (e.g., 01-01-01-scene.md) have excellent sensory/beat detail; Act docs lack this granularity
- Character interactions (not just individual traits) are what bring scenes alive in prose

## Writing Patterns That Worked
- novel-01-01-01.md: Opening with environmental description (time, light, space) sets scene effectively
- Character introduction through action (Sujin writing journal, Jihoon at window, Minjun on phone) works better than static description
- Tension-comedy rhythm: serious moment -> Minjun's camera -> relief -> back to plot

## Character Voice Notes
- Minjun: Camera always ready, "대박 콘텐츠" as reflex; should evolve subtly across acts
- Sujin: Public/private mode switch is best shown through physical contrast (posture, speech formality)
- Jihoon: Speaks in short sentences, nature metaphors come naturally, Gyeoul reflects his emotions
- Jiyoung: Enters scenes with energy/noise; physical presence described before dialogue
- Taeho: Introduces stats/probabilities; glasses-adjusting as thinking gesture
