# Evaluation History - Detailed Records

## Act Evaluation Criteria (Created 2026-02-07, Updated 2026-02-07)
- Doc: /Users/donghyunkim/Documents/codes/konies/act/act-evaluation-criteria.md
- 5 categories: Structure(25), Narrative Function(25), Character(20), Tone(15), Consistency(15) = 100pts
- Grade: S(90+), A(80+), B(70+), C(60+), D(<60); B+ required for Chapter doc creation
- Cross-evaluation: tension curve, character balance, motif tracking, volume ratio, foreshadowing tracking
- v2 changes: sub-criteria tables, B-1~B-6 coding, new C-6/D-5/D-6/E-6, required sections, setting conflict protocol
- v3 final: foreshadowing table filled, feedback/ folder specified, setting conflict arbiter = content director
- Key finding: "꽃이 피는 돌/석등" motif gap in Acts 2-4; Act 4 too dense (6 scenes at 15%); Epilogue needs scene breakdown

## Act 1 Evaluation Journey
- 1st eval (4 reviewers): Taesoo(C/60), Hyewon(D/54), Hojin(D/56), Yeonsu(D/57)
- Common issues: missing spatial route/time frame, growth arc, tone ratio, foreshadowing
- Reinforcement: 6 new sections, emotional arc 4->7 stages, turning points 3->5, legend narrator corrected (Sujin->Jihoon)
- Re-eval: A grade (83/100). All items 80%+.
- 2nd round: all 4 reviewers A grade (83-85). 5 items applied to 01-act.md.
- Applied: "연꽃 문양"->"불꽃이 피어나는 돌(석등)", character interaction, reader experience, foreshadowing split, pacing summary
- Rejected: scene-level details, time gap annotation, 지영 열정 다양화 (intentional starting weakness), prologue mapping (cross-eval phase)

## Chapter Evaluation Criteria (Created 2026-02-08, v2 2026-02-08)
- Doc: /Users/donghyunkim/Documents/codes/konies/chapter/chapter-evaluation-criteria.md

- v2 changes: 19 items from 4 reviewers. A-3/B-4 duplication resolved, D-1/D-2 role clarified, scoring anchors, 11 required sections, balance-5 added
- Feedback patterns: 3/4 flagged mini-climax duplication, 3/4 flagged foreshadowing missing, 2/4 flagged D-1/D-2 overlap, 2/4 flagged scoring anchors

## Chapter 01-01 Evaluation Journey
- **1st eval (D/42)**: Taesoo. A=10/25, B=11/25, C=10/20, D=3/15, E=8/15. D항목 20% = critical failure.
- **4-person 1st round**: Taesoo(D/42), Hyewon(D/51), Yeonsu(D/53), Hojin(D/54). Avg 50pts. All D grade.
- Root causes: no tone/pacing, no subplot goals, no mini-climax, no info strategy, no cognitive load management
- **Reinforcement**: 134->359 lines (2.7x). All 11 required sections added. Single scene maintained with 5-moment structure.
- Key innovations: tag behaviors, "3+2" character intro, info dump prevention 3-strategy, specific hooks
- **2nd eval (A/87)**: Taesoo. A=22/25, B=22/25, C=17/20, D=13/15, E=13/15. All items 85%+. +45pt gain.

- 6 recommended improvements for S grade (90+): A-2 self-check note, B-4 reader emotion effect, D-6 vocabulary guide, E-4 spatial route alignment, E-5 겨울이 behavior spec, C-5 지훈-겨울이 interaction

## Chapter 01-02 (Pending)
- Evaluation example score: C (67/100) in criteria doc
- Formal evaluation not yet performed
- Needs reinforcement to B+ for Scene doc creation

## Team Feedback Patterns
- Hyewon (plot): narrative dynamics, foreshadowing vs motif, info revelation; tracks 지영 character depth
- Hojin (writing): practical needs - space/time, sensory details, character chemistry; "숲의 설계도" metaphor
- Yeonsu (editing): formal consistency, cross-verification, process gaps; found "마을 빚 50억" gap
- Rejected pattern: all suggested expanded scoring - kept at 5 items
- D항목 배점 재조정: pending review after 3+ evaluations (01-01 D항목 was weakest -> supports rebalancing case)
