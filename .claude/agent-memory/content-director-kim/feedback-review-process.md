# Feedback Review Process - Lessons Learned

## Context
First 4-evaluator feedback review completed 2026-02-08 for chapter/01-01-chapter.md.

## Workflow (Proven Effective)
1. Read all evaluator feedback documents first (do NOT start responding mid-read)
2. Read the target document and all reference documents
3. Consolidate all unique improvement items across evaluators
4. Count how many evaluators flagged each item (priority = count)
5. Classify each: Accept / Hold / Reject with clear rationale
6. Write report with summary tables, classification, and recommendations
7. Apply accepted items to target document
8. Write response to each evaluator's feedback (per-item accept/hold/reject with rationale)
9. Update agent memory

## Classification Principles
- **3+ evaluators = auto-accept** unless there's a structural reason not to
- **Act document changes = always hold** (cannot modify unilaterally)
- **Scene-level details = reference** (not Chapter scope)
- **Cross-chapter items = reference** (handle in receiving chapter, not sending)
- **1 evaluator + low effort = accept** if it improves document quality
- **1 evaluator + structural change = hold** for discussion

## Scoring Patterns Observed
- 4 evaluators with consistent criteria produce very tight score ranges (3-point spread)
- Evaluator role influences which items they score higher:
  - 집필작가(Hojin): Higher C scores (practical usability of character directions)
  - 편집작가(Yeonsu): Higher D scores (tone design organic system)
  - 플롯작가(Hyewon): Strictest on E scores (structural consistency)
  - 콘텐츠 팀장(Taesoo): Balanced, slightly conservative

## Response Writing Tips
- Acknowledge each evaluator's unique contribution/perspective
- Reference specific scores where they diverged from others
- For "hold" items, always state the dependency and recommended resolution
- For "reference" items, state where they'll be handled instead
- Credit evaluators whose suggested wording was used in revisions

## Key Insight: "Specification Reveals Weaknesses"
When documents become more detailed (e.g., moment-by-moment guide), previously hidden issues become visible. The moment 3->4 transition coincidence was always there but only surfaced when explicit transition triggers were documented. This is inherently positive -- transparent documents enable targeted fixes.
