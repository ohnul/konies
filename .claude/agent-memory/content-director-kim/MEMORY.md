## Project Structure Decisions
- 4-Act structure (not 3-Act) with Prologue/Epilogue
- Units: Act > Chapter > Scene; Beat/Moment used inside Scene docs (not as separate files)
- Omitted units: Part, Episode (absorbed by Chapter), Sequence (absorbed by Chapter)
- Chapter numbering: Absolute across entire work (e.g., 02-03 = Act 2, Chapter 3 globally)
- Templates: No separate template files; structure definitions inline in plot-structure.md

## Known Document Inconsistencies (as of 2026-02-06)
- CLAUDE.md lists template files that don't exist (template-scene.md, template-seq.md, etc.)
- Chapter doc structure in plot-structure.md missing "mini-climax" and "subplot objective" (Episode/Sequence function absorption)
- README.md has wrong filenames: `characters-overview.md` should be `character-overview.md`, `settings-overview.md` should be `setting-overview.md`
- README.md and plot-structure.md have different Act subtitles for Acts 2 and 3
- CLAUDE.md example uses relative numbering (`01-03-chapter.md` = Act 1, Chapter 3) but actual files use absolute numbering
- CLAUDE.md says "Three-act structure" but work uses 4-act structure

## Completed Work Status
- Act 1 fully structured: 2 chapters, 5 scenes (01-01-01 through 01-02-04)
- Prologue structured (00-prologue-v2.md)
- Novel files exist for prologue (novel-00-00-01, novel-00-00-02) and Act 1 beginning (novel-01-01-01, novel-01-02-01)
- Acts 2-4 and epilogue: structure planned but no detailed scene docs yet

## Editorial Observations
- Scene docs (e.g., 01-01-01-scene.md) are richly detailed with Beat/Moment structure, dialogue drafts, and [NOTE-TO-AI] markers
- Chapter docs serve as solid intermediate summaries
- Act docs properly aggregate chapter-level information
- The 60/40 adventure-tension/friendship-humor balance is well-articulated in rules but needs verification in actual novel files
- 4th Act at 15% may be too compressed for "final confrontation + treasure discovery" - consider 20%
