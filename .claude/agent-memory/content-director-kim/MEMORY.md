## Quick Reference
- [Evaluation History](evaluation-history.md) - detailed eval records, criteria changes, team patterns
- [Full Review 2026-02-06](full-review-2026-02-06.md) - initial full project review

## Project Structure
- 4-Act structure with Prologue/Epilogue. Units: Act > Chapter > Scene (Beat/Moment inside Scene)
- Omitted: Part, Episode (->Chapter), Sequence (->Chapter). Chapter numbering: absolute across work
- Pipeline: act/ -> chapter/ -> scene/ -> novel/ -> final/

## Known Document Inconsistencies (2026-02-06)
- CLAUDE.md: lists nonexistent templates, says "Three-act" (actually 4-act), numbering example inconsistent
- README.md: wrong filenames (characters-overview, settings-overview), different Act subtitles from plot-structure.md
- Prologue numbering: 00-prologue-v2.md vs scenes 00-00-01/00-00-02
- setting-overview.md: "마을 빚 50억" not formalized yet (used in act/chapter/scene/novel/final)

## Completed Work Status (Updated 2026-02-08)
- **Act docs**: All created (00-prologue through 05-epilogue). 01-act-confirmed.md = A grade (83pts)
- **Chapter docs**: 01-01 = A grade (87pts, SCENE APPROVED). 01-02 = pending formal eval (estimated C/67). Acts 2-4 chapters not created
- **Scene docs**: Act 1 complete (01-01-01 through 01-02-04). Prologue 2 scenes. Acts 2-4 none
- **Novel/Final**: f-0-prologue.md, f-1-friends.md finalized. Working drafts in novel/
- **Evaluation criteria**: Act (v3, finalized), Chapter (v2, finalized)

## Editorial Observations
- Act 1 Ch1 single-scene structure: maintained per spacetime principle, managed via 5-moment internal structure + cognitive load strategy (3+2 character intro, tag behaviors, info repetition)
- "Tag behaviors" concept: 수진(펜 떨어뜨림), 지훈(창가 겨울이), 민준(카메라), 지영(문 쾅), 태호(확률 계산)
- Tone ratio Act 1: 55% friendship/humor, 45% adventure/tension (default 60/40 adjusted for setup act)
- Act 4 compression risk: 6 scenes at 15% volume - needs expansion consideration
- 01-01-chapter.md reinforcement was transformative: 134->359 lines, D(42)->A(87), +45pts
- Key lesson: Chapter docs need Episode/Sequence absorption features explicitly; docs written before eval criteria lack these

## Evaluation Scoring Insights
- D항목(Tone/Pacing/Reader) consistently the weakest area in initial evaluations
- D항목 rebalancing (15->20): deferred until 3+ chapter evaluations. Evidence accumulating FOR rebalancing.
- Single-scene chapters: A-2 scoring ceiling is 4/6 due to structural load concern even with good justification
- "Seed-level" subplot goals acceptable for setup chapters; B-3 scores 4/5 with proper verb+result format
- All items at 85%+ = well-balanced doc; any item below 40% = mandatory remediation

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. ~~Re-evaluate 01-01-chapter.md~~ DONE: A/87, Scene approved
2. Evaluate 01-02-chapter.md formally -> reinforce to B+ -> Scene approval
3. Evaluate remaining Act docs (00-prologue, 02-act, 03-act, 04-act, 05-epilogue)
4. Create Chapter docs for Acts 2-4
5. Cross-evaluation after all Acts reach B+
6. Formalize "마을 빚 50억" in setting-overview.md
7. Add CLAUDE.md "서브플롯" term definition
