## Quick Reference
- [Evaluation History](evaluation-history.md) - detailed eval records, criteria changes, team patterns
- [Full Review 2026-02-06](full-review-2026-02-06.md) - initial full project review
- [Feedback Review Process](feedback-review-process.md) - lessons from 4-evaluator feedback review

## Project Structure
- 4-Act structure with Prologue/Epilogue. Units: Act > Chapter > Scene (Beat/Moment inside Scene)
- Omitted: Part, Episode (->Chapter), Sequence (->Chapter). Chapter numbering: absolute across work
- Pipeline: act/ -> chapter/ -> scene/ -> novel/ -> final/

## Known Document Inconsistencies (2026-02-06)
- CLAUDE.md: lists nonexistent templates, says "Three-act" (actually 4-act), numbering example inconsistent
- README.md: wrong filenames (characters-overview, settings-overview), different Act subtitles from plot-structure.md
- Prologue numbering: 00-prologue-v2.md vs scenes 00-00-01/00-00-02
- setting-overview.md: "마을 빚 50억" not formalized yet (used in act/chapter/scene/novel/final)
- ~~Act-Chapter spatial inconsistency~~: RESOLVED 2026-02-08. Act: "복도(탈출) -> 운동장(경유)", Chapter: "복도(교실 탈출 시) -> 운동장(경유, 지영/태호 시점의 창밖 장면)". Report 보류1 -> 해결됨
- ~~Foreshadowing classification drift~~: RESOLVED 2026-02-08. 겨울이/지영태호 복선 모두 Act/Chapter 양쪽 "보류"로 통일. 최종원고 단계에서 구체화하기로 합의.

## Completed Work Status (Updated 2026-02-09)
- **Act docs**: All created (00-prologue through 05-epilogue). 01-act-confirmed.md = A grade (83pts)
- **Chapter docs**: 01-01 = A grade (avg 87pts across 4 evaluators, feedback applied, SCENE APPROVED). 01-02 = **A grade (태수 2차 86pts)**, reinforced 2026-02-08 (116->361 lines), re-evaluated 2026-02-09. SCENE APPROVED. Acts 2-4 chapters not created
- **Scene docs**: Act 1 complete (01-01-01 through 01-02-04). Prologue 2 scenes. Acts 2-4 none
- **Novel/Final**: f-0-prologue.md, f-1-friends.md finalized. Working drafts in novel/
- **Evaluation criteria**: Act (v3, finalized), Chapter (v2, finalized), Scene (v1.1, 2026-02-09, 4-evaluator feedback applied)
- **Reports**: report/20260208-2100-01-01-chapter-feedback-report.md (4-evaluator feedback synthesis)

## Editorial Observations
- Act 1 Ch1 single-scene structure: maintained per spacetime principle, managed via 5-moment internal structure + cognitive load strategy (3+2 character intro, tag behaviors, info repetition)
- "Tag behaviors" concept: 수진(펜 떨어뜨림), 지훈(창가 겨울이), 민준(카메라), 지영(문 쾅), 태호(확률 계산)
- Tone ratio Act 1: 55% friendship/humor, 45% adventure/tension (default 60/40 adjusted for setup act)
- Act 4 compression risk: 6 scenes at 15% volume - needs expansion consideration
- 01-01-chapter.md reinforcement was transformative: 134->359->368 lines, D(42)->A(87)->A(~89-91 est.)
- Key lesson: Chapter docs need Episode/Sequence absorption features explicitly; docs written before eval criteria lack these

## 4-Evaluator Feedback Review Insights (2026-02-08)
- **Score consistency**: 4 evaluators scored 85/87/88/88. 3-point range = very high inter-rater agreement
- **Common items get priority**: Items flagged by 3+ evaluators were auto-accepted (D-5 tactile, D-6 terms, B-3 subplots)
- **Act-Chapter sync issues need team coordination**: Cannot resolve Act document changes unilaterally
- **"Specification reveals weaknesses" pattern**: As docs become more detailed, previously hidden issues emerge (e.g., moment 3->4 transition coincidence). This is a feature, not a bug.
- **Feedback review workflow**: Read all 4 -> consolidate unique items -> classify accept/hold/reject -> write report -> apply accepted -> respond to each evaluator
- **C-4 boundary**: Chapter docs handle "weakness exposure moments"; internal psychological aftermath is Scene-level scope
- **E-2 boundary**: Movement between chapters (교실->마을) is better handled by the receiving chapter (01-02), not the sending chapter (01-01)

## Evaluation Scoring Insights
- D항목(Tone/Pacing/Reader) consistently the weakest area in initial evaluations
- D항목 rebalancing (15->20): deferred until 3+ chapter evaluations. Evidence accumulating FOR rebalancing.
- Single-scene chapters: A-2 scoring ceiling is 4/6 due to structural load concern even with good justification. But 연수 gave 5/6, suggesting detailed time-flow indicators can push higher.
- "Seed-level" subplot goals acceptable for setup chapters; B-3 scores 4/5 with proper verb+result format. 5/5 possible with all 5 characters covered.
- All items at 85%+ = well-balanced doc; any item below 40% = mandatory remediation
- B-4: 이연수 gave 5/5 (others 4/5). Editors may weight narrative completeness over reader emotion specification.

## 01-02-chapter.md 4-Evaluator Review (2026-02-08)
- **Scores**: 태수 49, 호진 50, 연수 53, 혜원 56. Avg=52, Range=7pts (wider than 01-01's 3pt range)
- **All 4 = D grade**. Unanimous: Scene docs cannot proceed.
- **Root cause**: Document written BEFORE eval criteria existed. Lacks Episode/Sequence absorption features entirely.
- **8 common issues (4/4 agreement)**: (1) "연꽃 문양" -> "꽃받침 형태" fix, (2) subplot section missing, (3) mini-climax unspecified, (4) humor placement = 0, (5) tension/release rhythm absent, (6) ref filename mismatch, (7) character arc absent, (8) time frame mismatch (6pm vs 7pm)
- **지훈 "논리적 사고" misclassification**: 3/4 flagged (태수/연수/호진). His actual trait is "문자 그대로 해석".
- **Score variance analysis**: C항목 had widest range (혜원12 vs 호진8). 혜원 more lenient on C-1(3/3 vs others 2/3) and C-2(3/4 vs others 2/4). D항목 most consistent (6-7, tightest range).
- **B-5 discrepancy**: 태수 4/4(generous) vs 연수/호진 3/4. "전환 트리거 미명시" is valid deduction.
- **Strongest point**: B-5 (causal chain) = avg 3.5/4. The 5-step puzzle structure is solid.
- **Weakest point**: D-4 (humor) = 0/2 (3 evaluators), 1/2 (호진). Pattern confirmed: D항목 weakest in initial evals.
- **Notable insights by evaluator**: 연수="작품 정체성 40% 누락", 호진="캐릭터가 살아 있지 않다", 혜원="분량 큰 장이 가이드 적은 역설", 호진="5월 일몰 7:10pm" data
- **연수 subplot suggestion (held)**: "민준 촬영 집착이 마찰 발생" -- Act says "시너지 첫 증명" so friction deferred to Act 2+
- **Estimated post-reinforcement**: 70-80pts (B to A range) -- **ACTUAL: 86pts (A)**. Estimate was conservative.
- **Feedback response completed**: 팀장 응답 added to all 4 eval files (2026-02-08)
- **Reinforcement applied 2026-02-08**: 116->361 lines. All 8 common issues addressed:
  - (1) "연꽃 문양" fully replaced with "꽃받침 형태" (18 occurrences)
  - (2) 서브플롯 목표 섹션 신설 (4 entries with 동사+결과)
  - (3) 미니 클라이맥스 "씬2후반~씬3 삼인조 시너지" 확정, 독자감정/스케일/주제연결 명시
  - (4) 유머 요소 배치 5패턴 표, 씬별 배치 명시
  - (5) 긴장/이완 리듬: ASCII곡선 + 이완구간5개 + 전환트리거6개
  - (6) 참조문서명: 01-act-confirmed.md, 01-01-chapter-confirmed.md, scene/ 경로 포함
  - (7) 캐릭터 아크 진행 3명 (수진/지훈/민준), 1장 약점->2장 변화 조짐 표
  - (8) Act 정합성: 막내위치(70%), 감정아크(5~7단계), 시간(~7시경), 공간동선 모두 명시
- **추가 반영**: 지훈 "논리적 사고"->"문자 그대로 해석" 수정, 정보공개전략 표, 인지부하관리, 감각키워드 씬별 표, 캐릭터 포커스 4단계(중심/주요/보조/부재), 겨울이 "감정반응" 방향 통일

## 01-02-chapter.md 2nd Evaluation (2026-02-09, 태수 only)
- **Score**: 86pts / A grade (up from 49pts / D)
- **Score breakdown**: A=22/25, B=22/25, C=16/20, D=13/15, E=13/15
- **All items at 80%+**: most balanced doc so far. No item below 80%.
- **1차 필수 보완 8건 전부 이행 확인**
- **01-01과의 질적 격차 해소**: 87 vs 86, 1점 차 (C-5 상호작용 설계에서 미세 차이)
- **Remaining weaknesses**: C-5 (interaction design, 2/4), D-3 (cognitive load, 2/3), E-5 (foreshadowing, 2/3)
- **5 recommendations for S grade**: (1) interaction depth, (2) Scene 2 internal moments, (3) 탈옥범 reminder device, (4) 지훈 nature-talk trait formalization, (5) sensory transition planning
- **Key insight**: D항목 rebalancing hypothesis weakened -- 01-02 scored 13/15 (87%) on D, proving current 15-point allocation is sufficient for well-designed docs. D항목 weakness in initial evals is a doc quality issue, not a criteria weight issue.
- **Pattern confirmed**: "Pre-criteria docs score D, post-reinforcement docs score A" = consistent across 01-01 and 01-02

## Scene Evaluation Criteria Design Notes (2026-02-09)
- Scene = smallest structural unit. No sub-documents. Converts directly to novel/ files.
- Beat absorption: B-2 evaluates emotion tracking per beat. A-3 evaluates structural appropriateness of beat/moment division.
- Moment absorption: D-1 evaluates atmosphere transition design per moment.
- Key differentiator from Chapter criteria: **specificity level**. Scene requires "novel-writable" level: dialogue examples (not just direction), sensory descriptions (not just keywords), pacing guide (beat-level tempo).
- C-2 (dialogue) is 6pts (highest in C항목) because Scene is last stop before novel. Character voice must be concretely defined here.
- Dual-scoring prevention: A-3 checks structural presence of beat/moment; B-2/D-1 check content effectiveness.
- Existing Scene docs (01-01-01 through 01-02-04) were written pre-criteria. Expected pattern: D-grade initial -> A-grade post-reinforcement (same as chapter docs).
- **Evaluation example insight**: 01-02-02 scored C/67pts. Main issues: (1) "연꽃 문양" setting conflict, (2) time mismatch with Chapter, (3) Moment 1 emotion flatness, (4) missing pacing guide. These mirror Chapter initial evaluation patterns.
- Balanced-6 added to appendix: time continuity check between scenes (addresses recurring time mismatch issue found in both chapter and scene evals).
- 01-02-02's Moment 1 (4 location beats with no emotion progression) is a concrete example of "beat-level emotion tracking failure" -- useful teaching case for future evaluations.

## Scene Eval Criteria Self-Review + 4-Evaluator Feedback (2026-02-09)
- **Self-review grade**: A. 4 feedbacks filed: feedback/20260209-1700-scene-eval-crit-feedback-{taesoo,hyewon,yeonsu,hojin}.md
- **4-evaluator consensus**: All 4 graded A- to A. Key common issues: (1) A-3/B-2/D-1 boundary, (2) D-6 pacing anchor, (3) B-5 structure
- **v1.1 applied 19 items**: A-3/B-2/D-1 삼분 명확화, D-6 앵커, B-5 세부구조, B-1 역할분리+서브플롯, D-3 차등적용+예시, B-4 정당한and then, D-5 긴장감/공포 경계, 프롤로그 치환 규칙, 균형-2/4 구분 등
- **5 items held -> ALL RESOLVED 2026-02-09**: User feedback applied. (1) 감정선=선택지2 확정+ASCII 전면 제거 방침, (2) B-3 독자지식=선택지2 방향확정(Scene 2건 보강후), (3) 균형-7=선택지2 방향확정(균형점검후), (4) E-3=선택지3 확정+표제거검토 신규, (5) D-4=현행유지(원고작성후 최종판단)
- **7 items rejected**: 비트 서사적 필수성(B-4 과부하), Key Image 독립화(D항목 포화), C-2 5점 앵커(형식 불균형), 예시 분리(즉시 대조 가치), 밀도 판정 공식화, 전환 트리거 용어 정의, 필수 섹션 축소
- **Eval example rescored**: A-3 4->5(구조적 판단으로 수정), B-2 3->2(감정 단조 집중), D-6 0->1(앵커 적용). Total 67->68pts, still C grade
- **Key lesson - "집필자 자유" 원칙**: 호진의 핵심 통찰. Scene 문서가 소설 초안이 되면 안 됨. D-3 차등 적용(일반 비트=키워드), D-6 문체 지시 집필자 재량, C-2 간접 지시 활용 -- 모두 "설계도 vs 시공"의 경계를 지키는 원칙
- **"연꽃 문양" is systemic**: STILL OPEN. Fix needed across ALL Scene docs
- **3-tier eval criteria now complete**: Act(v3)->Chapter(v2)->Scene(v1.1). All use same structure, 40% floor rule
- **Pending decisions report**: report/20260209-scene-eval-crit-pending-decisions.md (5 items -> all resolved with user feedback)

## ASCII Removal Policy (2026-02-09, user-initiated)
- **Direction**: Remove ALL ASCII art/graphs across project. Replace with keyword enumeration.
- **Rationale**: User judges ASCII readability vs. effort as insufficient. Keyword lists convey same info more compactly.
- **Scope**: (1) Scene eval criteria: 감정선 필수섹션 62행 + 균형-2 다이어그램 457-464행, (2) Chapter confirmed docs: 01-01 273행+, 01-02 137행+ "긴장 곡선" sections, (3) Act eval criteria: 횡단-1 ASCII graph
- **Implementation**: Scene eval = immediate (next Scene reinforcement). Chapter/Act = at next doc update.
- **Note**: B-2's "자연스러운 곡선을 그리는가" (134행) is metaphorical, not ASCII -- keep as is.

## Eval Criteria Format Efficiency Review (2026-02-09, user-initiated)
- **Proposal**: Remove tables that duplicate body text in eval criteria docs. Use lists only.
- **Targets**: Score summary tables, required section checklists, balance check templates
- **Review criteria**: (1) table-body info overlap, (2) info loss risk, (3) context window savings
- **Timing**: Scene eval v1.2 update, applied across all 3 criteria docs (Act/Chapter/Scene)

## 01-02-01-scene.md Evaluation (2026-02-09, 태수 only)
- **Score**: 53pts / D grade. Lowest scene eval so far.
- **Score breakdown**: A=14/25, B=14/25, C=11/20, D=7/15, E=7/15
- **Root cause**: Written before BOTH Scene eval criteria AND Chapter confirmed doc. Double misalignment.
- **Critical issue**: E-3=0/3. Time mismatch (Scene 3:30pm vs Chapter 4:15pm). Transition trigger character swapped (지훈 vs 수진).
- **Weakest area**: D항목 (47%) and E항목 (47%). D-6 pacing=0/2, D-1 transition=1/3. E-3 정합=0/3, E-5 복선=1/3.
- **Strongest area**: C-2 dialogue (4/6). Rich dialogue examples (30+), clear character voice differentiation.
- **Compared to 01-02-02 (C/68)**: 15pts lower due to (1) larger time mismatch, (2) no reference section at all, (3) worse transition design and pacing.
- **8 mandatory fixes**: time alignment, trigger character fix, reference section, transition design, emotion tracking, pacing guide, foreshadowing system, 지훈 trait label
- **Estimated post-reinforcement**: B/75pts (conservative), A possible with recommended items
- **Pattern confirmed again**: Pre-criteria Scene docs score D-C. This is now 3rd data point (01-02-01=D/53, 01-02-02=C/68, extrapolating 01-01-01 likely similar range)
- **New insight**: Scene docs written before Chapter reinforcement have DOUBLE deficit -- they lack both Scene-level features AND updated Chapter data. This makes them consistently lower scoring than Scene docs written after Chapter reinforcement but before Scene criteria (like 01-02-02 which at least has correct Chapter data for some items).
