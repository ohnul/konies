## Quick Reference
- [Evaluation History](evaluation-history.md) - detailed eval records, criteria changes, team patterns
- [Full Review 2026-02-06](full-review-2026-02-06.md) - initial full project review
- [Feedback Review Process](feedback-review-process.md) - lessons from 4-evaluator feedback review

## Project Structure
- 4-Act structure with Prologue/Epilogue. Units: Act > Chapter > Scene (Beat/Moment inside Scene)
- Omitted: Part, Episode (->Chapter), Sequence (->Chapter). Chapter numbering: absolute across work
- Pipeline: act/ -> chapter/ -> scene/ -> novel/ -> final/

## Known Document Inconsistencies (2026-02-06)
- CLAUDE.md: lists nonexistent templates, says "Three-act" (actually 4-act), numbering example inconsistent
- README.md: wrong filenames (characters-overview, settings-overview), different Act subtitles from plot-structure.md
- Prologue numbering: 00-prologue-v2.md vs scenes 00-00-01/00-00-02
- setting-overview.md: "마을 빚 50억" not formalized yet (used in act/chapter/scene/novel/final)
- ~~Act-Chapter spatial inconsistency~~: RESOLVED 2026-02-08. Act: "복도(탈출) -> 운동장(경유)", Chapter: "복도(교실 탈출 시) -> 운동장(경유, 지영/태호 시점의 창밖 장면)". Report 보류1 -> 해결됨
- ~~Foreshadowing classification drift~~: RESOLVED 2026-02-08. 겨울이/지영태호 복선 모두 Act/Chapter 양쪽 "보류"로 통일. 최종원고 단계에서 구체화하기로 합의.

## Completed Work Status (Updated 2026-02-08)
- **Act docs**: All created (00-prologue through 05-epilogue). 01-act-confirmed.md = A grade (83pts)
- **Chapter docs**: 01-01 = A grade (avg 87pts across 4 evaluators, feedback applied, SCENE APPROVED). 01-02 = D grade (avg 52pts), **reinforced 2026-02-08** (116->361 lines, 8 items applied, awaiting re-eval). Acts 2-4 chapters not created
- **Scene docs**: Act 1 complete (01-01-01 through 01-02-04). Prologue 2 scenes. Acts 2-4 none
- **Novel/Final**: f-0-prologue.md, f-1-friends.md finalized. Working drafts in novel/
- **Evaluation criteria**: Act (v3, finalized), Chapter (v2, finalized)
- **Reports**: report/20260208-2100-01-01-chapter-feedback-report.md (4-evaluator feedback synthesis)

## Editorial Observations
- Act 1 Ch1 single-scene structure: maintained per spacetime principle, managed via 5-moment internal structure + cognitive load strategy (3+2 character intro, tag behaviors, info repetition)
- "Tag behaviors" concept: 수진(펜 떨어뜨림), 지훈(창가 겨울이), 민준(카메라), 지영(문 쾅), 태호(확률 계산)
- Tone ratio Act 1: 55% friendship/humor, 45% adventure/tension (default 60/40 adjusted for setup act)
- Act 4 compression risk: 6 scenes at 15% volume - needs expansion consideration
- 01-01-chapter.md reinforcement was transformative: 134->359->368 lines, D(42)->A(87)->A(~89-91 est.)
- Key lesson: Chapter docs need Episode/Sequence absorption features explicitly; docs written before eval criteria lack these

## 4-Evaluator Feedback Review Insights (2026-02-08)
- **Score consistency**: 4 evaluators scored 85/87/88/88. 3-point range = very high inter-rater agreement
- **Common items get priority**: Items flagged by 3+ evaluators were auto-accepted (D-5 tactile, D-6 terms, B-3 subplots)
- **Act-Chapter sync issues need team coordination**: Cannot resolve Act document changes unilaterally
- **"Specification reveals weaknesses" pattern**: As docs become more detailed, previously hidden issues emerge (e.g., moment 3->4 transition coincidence). This is a feature, not a bug.
- **Feedback review workflow**: Read all 4 -> consolidate unique items -> classify accept/hold/reject -> write report -> apply accepted -> respond to each evaluator
- **C-4 boundary**: Chapter docs handle "weakness exposure moments"; internal psychological aftermath is Scene-level scope
- **E-2 boundary**: Movement between chapters (교실->마을) is better handled by the receiving chapter (01-02), not the sending chapter (01-01)

## Evaluation Scoring Insights
- D항목(Tone/Pacing/Reader) consistently the weakest area in initial evaluations
- D항목 rebalancing (15->20): deferred until 3+ chapter evaluations. Evidence accumulating FOR rebalancing.
- Single-scene chapters: A-2 scoring ceiling is 4/6 due to structural load concern even with good justification. But 연수 gave 5/6, suggesting detailed time-flow indicators can push higher.
- "Seed-level" subplot goals acceptable for setup chapters; B-3 scores 4/5 with proper verb+result format. 5/5 possible with all 5 characters covered.
- All items at 85%+ = well-balanced doc; any item below 40% = mandatory remediation
- B-4: 이연수 gave 5/5 (others 4/5). Editors may weight narrative completeness over reader emotion specification.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. ~~Re-evaluate 01-01-chapter.md~~ DONE: A/87 avg, feedback applied (8 accepted items)
2. ~~Resolve Act-Chapter spatial inconsistency~~ DONE: 2026-02-08, aligned to final/f-1-friends.md
3. ~~Sync foreshadowing classifications~~ DONE: 2026-02-08. 겨울이/지영태호 양쪽 "보류"로 통일, Act/Chapter/Report 3개 문서 동기화 완료
4. ~~Evaluate 01-02-chapter.md formally~~ DONE: D/avg52pts (4 evaluators: 49/50/53/56). Feedback responses added.
5. ~~Reinforce 01-02-chapter.md~~: DONE 2026-02-08. 8 common issues applied. 116->361 lines. Awaiting re-evaluation.
6. Evaluate remaining Act docs (00-prologue, 02-act, 03-act, 04-act, 05-epilogue)
6. Create Chapter docs for Acts 2-4
7. Cross-evaluation after all Acts reach B+
8. Formalize "마을 빚 50억" in setting-overview.md
9. Add CLAUDE.md "서브플롯" term definition
10. Formalize "통합학급" setting in character-overview.md (지훈 14세/초등팀 tension)

## 01-02-chapter.md 4-Evaluator Review (2026-02-08)
- **Scores**: 태수 49, 호진 50, 연수 53, 혜원 56. Avg=52, Range=7pts (wider than 01-01's 3pt range)
- **All 4 = D grade**. Unanimous: Scene docs cannot proceed.
- **Root cause**: Document written BEFORE eval criteria existed. Lacks Episode/Sequence absorption features entirely.
- **8 common issues (4/4 agreement)**: (1) "연꽃 문양" -> "꽃받침 형태" fix, (2) subplot section missing, (3) mini-climax unspecified, (4) humor placement = 0, (5) tension/release rhythm absent, (6) ref filename mismatch, (7) character arc absent, (8) time frame mismatch (6pm vs 7pm)
- **지훈 "논리적 사고" misclassification**: 3/4 flagged (태수/연수/호진). His actual trait is "문자 그대로 해석".
- **Score variance analysis**: C항목 had widest range (혜원12 vs 호진8). 혜원 more lenient on C-1(3/3 vs others 2/3) and C-2(3/4 vs others 2/4). D항목 most consistent (6-7, tightest range).
- **B-5 discrepancy**: 태수 4/4(generous) vs 연수/호진 3/4. "전환 트리거 미명시" is valid deduction.
- **Strongest point**: B-5 (causal chain) = avg 3.5/4. The 5-step puzzle structure is solid.
- **Weakest point**: D-4 (humor) = 0/2 (3 evaluators), 1/2 (호진). Pattern confirmed: D항목 weakest in initial evals.
- **Notable insights by evaluator**: 연수="작품 정체성 40% 누락", 호진="캐릭터가 살아 있지 않다", 혜원="분량 큰 장이 가이드 적은 역설", 호진="5월 일몰 7:10pm" data
- **연수 subplot suggestion (held)**: "민준 촬영 집착이 마찰 발생" -- Act says "시너지 첫 증명" so friction deferred to Act 2+
- **Estimated post-reinforcement**: 70-80pts (B to A range)
- **Feedback response completed**: 팀장 응답 added to all 4 eval files (2026-02-08)
- **Reinforcement applied 2026-02-08**: 116->361 lines. All 8 common issues addressed:
  - (1) "연꽃 문양" fully replaced with "꽃받침 형태" (18 occurrences)
  - (2) 서브플롯 목표 섹션 신설 (4 entries with 동사+결과)
  - (3) 미니 클라이맥스 "씬2후반~씬3 삼인조 시너지" 확정, 독자감정/스케일/주제연결 명시
  - (4) 유머 요소 배치 5패턴 표, 씬별 배치 명시
  - (5) 긴장/이완 리듬: ASCII곡선 + 이완구간5개 + 전환트리거6개
  - (6) 참조문서명: 01-act-confirmed.md, 01-01-chapter-confirmed.md, scene/ 경로 포함
  - (7) 캐릭터 아크 진행 3명 (수진/지훈/민준), 1장 약점->2장 변화 조짐 표
  - (8) Act 정합성: 막내위치(70%), 감정아크(5~7단계), 시간(~7시경), 공간동선 모두 명시
- **추가 반영**: 지훈 "논리적 사고"->"문자 그대로 해석" 수정, 정보공개전략 표, 인지부하관리, 감각키워드 씬별 표, 캐릭터 포커스 4단계(중심/주요/보조/부재), 겨울이 "감정반응" 방향 통일
