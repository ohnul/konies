## Quick Reference
- [Evaluation History](evaluation-history.md) - detailed eval records, criteria changes, team patterns
- [Full Review 2026-02-06](full-review-2026-02-06.md) - initial full project review
- [Feedback Review Process](feedback-review-process.md) - lessons from 4-evaluator feedback review

## Project Structure
- 4-Act structure with Prologue/Epilogue. Units: Act > Chapter > Scene (Beat/Moment inside Scene)
- Omitted: Part, Episode (->Chapter), Sequence (->Chapter). Chapter numbering: absolute across work
- Pipeline: act/ -> chapter/ -> scene/ -> novel/ -> final/

## Known Document Inconsistencies (2026-02-06)
- CLAUDE.md: lists nonexistent templates, says "Three-act" (actually 4-act), numbering example inconsistent
- README.md: wrong filenames (characters-overview, settings-overview), different Act subtitles from plot-structure.md
- Prologue numbering: 00-prologue-v2.md vs scenes 00-00-01/00-00-02
- setting-overview.md: "마을 빚 50억" not formalized yet (used in act/chapter/scene/novel/final)
- ~~Act-Chapter spatial inconsistency~~: RESOLVED 2026-02-08. Act: "복도(탈출) -> 운동장(경유)", Chapter: "복도(교실 탈출 시) -> 운동장(경유, 지영/태호 시점의 창밖 장면)". Report 보류1 -> 해결됨
- ~~Foreshadowing classification drift~~: RESOLVED 2026-02-08. 겨울이/지영태호 복선 모두 Act/Chapter 양쪽 "보류"로 통일. 최종원고 단계에서 구체화하기로 합의.

## Completed Work Status (Updated 2026-02-10)
- **Act docs**: All created (00-prologue through 05-epilogue). 01-act-confirmed.md = A grade (83pts). 02-act-confirmed.md = A grade (88pts, 태수 re-eval 2026-02-10). 03-act.md = D grade (avg 52pts, 4-eval), reinforced 83->217 lines (261%). CHAPTER CREATION PENDING re-eval. Acts 4-5 not evaluated
- **Chapter docs**: 01-01 = A grade (avg 87pts across 4 evaluators, feedback applied, SCENE APPROVED). 01-02 = **A grade (태수 2차 86pts)**, reinforced 2026-02-08 (116->361 lines), re-evaluated 2026-02-09. SCENE APPROVED. Acts 2-4 chapters not created
- **Scene docs**: Act 1 complete (01-01-01 through 01-02-04). Prologue 2 scenes. Acts 2-4 none
- **Novel/Final**: f-0-prologue.md, f-1-friends.md finalized. Working drafts in novel/
- **Evaluation criteria**: Act (v3, finalized), Chapter (v2, finalized), Scene (v1.1, 2026-02-09, 4-evaluator feedback applied)
- **Reports**: report/20260208-2100-01-01-chapter-feedback-report.md (4-evaluator feedback synthesis)

## Editorial Observations
- Act 1 Ch1 single-scene structure: maintained per spacetime principle, managed via 5-moment internal structure + cognitive load strategy (3+2 character intro, tag behaviors, info repetition)
- "Tag behaviors" concept: 수진(펜 떨어뜨림), 지훈(창가 겨울이), 민준(카메라), 지영(문 쾅), 태호(확률 계산)
- Tone ratio Act 1: 55% friendship/humor, 45% adventure/tension (default 60/40 adjusted for setup act)
- Act 4 compression risk: 6 scenes at 15% volume - needs expansion consideration
- 01-01-chapter.md reinforcement was transformative: 134->359->368 lines, D(42)->A(87)->A(~89-91 est.)
- Key lesson: Chapter docs need Episode/Sequence absorption features explicitly; docs written before eval criteria lack these
- Act 2 tone ratio: 65:35 (adventure:humor) adjusted from 60:40 due to high-tension events (capture, cave, chase)
- Act 3 tone ratio: 55:45 (adventure:humor) -- team bonding/growth focus lowers adventure ratio
- Act doc inter-rater range: 02-act=12pts, 03-act=7pts. 03-act has tighter agreement than 02-act.
- 02-act.md reinforcement size: 80->192 lines (240%). 43 lines MORE than 01-act-confirmed (149 lines) -- justified by 30% vs 20% volume share
- 03-act.md reinforcement size: 83->217 lines (261%). 25 lines MORE than 02-act-confirmed (192 lines) -- justified by 25% volume with most complex team dynamics (5-person team + 5 obstacles + growth arcs)

## 4-Evaluator Feedback Review Insights (2026-02-08)
- **Score consistency**: 4 evaluators scored 85/87/88/88. 3-point range = very high inter-rater agreement
- **Common items get priority**: Items flagged by 3+ evaluators were auto-accepted (D-5 tactile, D-6 terms, B-3 subplots)
- **Act-Chapter sync issues need team coordination**: Cannot resolve Act document changes unilaterally
- **"Specification reveals weaknesses" pattern**: As docs become more detailed, previously hidden issues emerge (e.g., moment 3->4 transition coincidence). This is a feature, not a bug.
- **Feedback review workflow**: Read all 4 -> consolidate unique items -> classify accept/hold/reject -> write report -> apply accepted -> respond to each evaluator
- **C-4 boundary**: Chapter docs handle "weakness exposure moments"; internal psychological aftermath is Scene-level scope
- **E-2 boundary**: Movement between chapters (교실->마을) is better handled by the receiving chapter (01-02), not the sending chapter (01-01)

## Evaluation Scoring Insights
- D항목(Tone/Pacing/Reader) consistently the weakest area in initial evaluations
- D항목 rebalancing (15->20): deferred until 3+ chapter evaluations. Evidence accumulating FOR rebalancing.
- Single-scene chapters: A-2 scoring ceiling is 4/6 due to structural load concern even with good justification. But 연수 gave 5/6, suggesting detailed time-flow indicators can push higher.
- "Seed-level" subplot goals acceptable for setup chapters; B-3 scores 4/5 with proper verb+result format. 5/5 possible with all 5 characters covered.
- All items at 85%+ = well-balanced doc; any item below 40% = mandatory remediation
- B-4: 이연수 gave 5/5 (others 4/5). Editors may weight narrative completeness over reader emotion specification.
- **Reinforcement pattern now confirmed across ALL doc types**: Act C->A(+27), Chapter D->A(+34~45), Scene D->A(+28). Average gain = +33.5pts.
- 02-act re-eval surpassed 01-act-confirmed by 5pts (88 vs 83). Later docs benefit from accumulated criteria knowledge and writing experience.

## 01-02-chapter.md Summary (Details in evaluation-history.md)
- **1st eval (4-person)**: avg D/52. 8 common issues. Written before eval criteria.
- **Reinforcement**: 116->361 lines. All 8 issues + 지훈 trait fix + 정보공개전략 + 인지부하관리 etc.
- **2nd eval (태수)**: A/86. All items 80%+. D항목 rebalancing hypothesis weakened (87% on D).
- **Pattern**: D/52 -> A/86 (+34). Same as 01-01 (D/50 -> A/87).

## Scene Evaluation Criteria Design Notes (2026-02-09)
- Scene = smallest structural unit. No sub-documents. Converts directly to novel/ files.
- Beat absorption: B-2 evaluates emotion tracking per beat. A-3 evaluates structural appropriateness of beat/moment division.
- Moment absorption: D-1 evaluates atmosphere transition design per moment.
- Key differentiator from Chapter criteria: **specificity level**. Scene requires "novel-writable" level: dialogue examples (not just direction), sensory descriptions (not just keywords), pacing guide (beat-level tempo).
- C-2 (dialogue) is 6pts (highest in C항목) because Scene is last stop before novel. Character voice must be concretely defined here.
- Dual-scoring prevention: A-3 checks structural presence of beat/moment; B-2/D-1 check content effectiveness.
- Existing Scene docs (01-01-01 through 01-02-04) were written pre-criteria. Expected pattern: D-grade initial -> A-grade post-reinforcement (same as chapter docs).
- **Evaluation example insight**: 01-02-02 scored C/67pts. Main issues: (1) "연꽃 문양" setting conflict, (2) time mismatch with Chapter, (3) Moment 1 emotion flatness, (4) missing pacing guide. These mirror Chapter initial evaluation patterns.
- Balanced-6 added to appendix: time continuity check between scenes (addresses recurring time mismatch issue found in both chapter and scene evals).
- 01-02-02's Moment 1 (4 location beats with no emotion progression) is a concrete example of "beat-level emotion tracking failure" -- useful teaching case for future evaluations.

## Scene Eval Criteria Self-Review + 4-Evaluator Feedback (2026-02-09)
- **Self-review grade**: A. 4 feedbacks filed: feedback/20260209-1700-scene-eval-crit-feedback-{taesoo,hyewon,yeonsu,hojin}.md
- **4-evaluator consensus**: All 4 graded A- to A. Key common issues: (1) A-3/B-2/D-1 boundary, (2) D-6 pacing anchor, (3) B-5 structure
- **v1.1 applied 19 items**: A-3/B-2/D-1 삼분 명확화, D-6 앵커, B-5 세부구조, B-1 역할분리+서브플롯, D-3 차등적용+예시, B-4 정당한and then, D-5 긴장감/공포 경계, 프롤로그 치환 규칙, 균형-2/4 구분 등
- **5 items held -> ALL RESOLVED 2026-02-09**: User feedback applied. (1) 감정선=선택지2 확정+ASCII 전면 제거 방침, (2) B-3 독자지식=선택지2 방향확정(Scene 2건 보강후), (3) 균형-7=선택지2 방향확정(균형점검후), (4) E-3=선택지3 확정+표제거검토 신규, (5) D-4=현행유지(원고작성후 최종판단)
- **7 items rejected**: 비트 서사적 필수성(B-4 과부하), Key Image 독립화(D항목 포화), C-2 5점 앵커(형식 불균형), 예시 분리(즉시 대조 가치), 밀도 판정 공식화, 전환 트리거 용어 정의, 필수 섹션 축소
- **Eval example rescored**: A-3 4->5(구조적 판단으로 수정), B-2 3->2(감정 단조 집중), D-6 0->1(앵커 적용). Total 67->68pts, still C grade
- **Key lesson - "집필자 자유" 원칙**: 호진의 핵심 통찰. Scene 문서가 소설 초안이 되면 안 됨. D-3 차등 적용(일반 비트=키워드), D-6 문체 지시 집필자 재량, C-2 간접 지시 활용 -- 모두 "설계도 vs 시공"의 경계를 지키는 원칙
- **"연꽃 문양" is systemic**: STILL OPEN. Fix needed across ALL Scene docs
- **3-tier eval criteria now complete**: Act(v3)->Chapter(v2)->Scene(v1.1). All use same structure, 40% floor rule
- **Pending decisions report**: report/20260209-scene-eval-crit-pending-decisions.md (5 items -> all resolved with user feedback)

## ASCII Removal Policy (2026-02-09, user-initiated)
- **Direction**: Remove ALL ASCII art/graphs across project. Replace with keyword enumeration.
- **Rationale**: User judges ASCII readability vs. effort as insufficient. Keyword lists convey same info more compactly.
- **Scope**: (1) Scene eval criteria: 감정선 필수섹션 62행 + 균형-2 다이어그램 457-464행, (2) Chapter confirmed docs: 01-01 273행+, 01-02 137행+ "긴장 곡선" sections, (3) Act eval criteria: 횡단-1 ASCII graph
- **Implementation**: Scene eval = immediate (next Scene reinforcement). Chapter/Act = at next doc update.
- **Note**: B-2's "자연스러운 곡선을 그리는가" (134행) is metaphorical, not ASCII -- keep as is.

## Eval Criteria Format Efficiency Review (2026-02-09, user-initiated)
- **Proposal**: Remove tables that duplicate body text in eval criteria docs. Use lists only.
- **Targets**: Score summary tables, required section checklists, balance check templates
- **Review criteria**: (1) table-body info overlap, (2) info loss risk, (3) context window savings
- **Timing**: Scene eval v1.2 update, applied across all 3 criteria docs (Act/Chapter/Scene)

## Scene Evaluation Summary (Details in evaluation-history.md)
- **01-02-01**: D/53 -> A/81 (+28). NOVEL APPROVED. Pattern: "대사 시나리오 -> 집필 설계도"
- **01-02-02**: D/53. Awaiting reinforcement. M1 emotion flatness worst case. "대사는 잘 쓰는 초안"
- **01-02-03**: D/44. Lowest in project. Mini-climax unimplemented + info regression. Confirmed version exists (332 lines).
- **01-02-04**: D/53.5 (태수) vs B/75.5 (팀). 22pt inter-rater gap. Critical: 종료훅+미행복선 미구현, 감정태그 전무, M1 "and then" 반복. Awaiting reinforcement.
- **D->A pattern**: All pre-criteria drafts score D. All reinforced docs score A. Consistent.
- **C-2 dialogue = strongest item** across ALL pre-criteria scenes (4/6 consistently). Dialogue quality survives structural absence.
- **B-2 emotion tags = weakest item** across ALL pre-criteria scenes (0-1/6). Core scaffolding gap.

## 01-02-04-scene.md Evaluation Insights (2026-02-09)
- **Score**: 53.5/D (태수). Team eval: 75.5/B. **22pt gap = largest inter-rater discrepancy in project**.
- **Gap root cause**: (1) B-1 5->2 (종료훅 "희미한 빛" + 미행복선 미구현 -- Chapter 핵심 장치 2건 동시 미이행), (2) B-2 4->1 (감정태그 전무), (3) A-2 5->3 (시작-끝 하늘 모순 + 종료훅 미포함)
- **Unique pattern**: 이 씬만 Chapter의 핵심 서사 장치를 2건 동시에 누락. 다른 3개 씬은 각각 1건씩 누락.
- **"연꽃 문양" clean**: 01-02-04는 석등 구조를 직접 묘사하지 않아 연꽃 문양 오염 없음.
- **시작-끝 하늘 모순**: 시작 "진한 남색"(해 진 후) vs 끝 "붉은 노을"(해 지는 중). 5월 일몰 7:10pm 기준, 6:45~7:00 구간은 "석양 마지막 단계 -> 어둠"이어야 함.
- **"경외감" vs "공포 접근" 톤 문제**: Chapter는 경외감 배정, Scene은 "귀신", "눈구멍", "으스스"로 공포 접근. 1막 마지막은 "무서움"이 아니라 "경이로움"이어야.
- **M1 "and then"**: 2~4번째 석등 발견이 감정 분화 없이 반복. "정당한 and then" 조건(누적효과 설계의도 명시) 미충족.
- **Confirmed 비교 기준 효과**: 01-02-03-confirmed(332행)와의 품질 격차가 평가 엄격화의 핵심 원인. 같은 Chapter 내 씬의 품질 편차가 크면, 낮은 씬이 더 낮게 보인다.
- **보강 후 예상**: 필수 8건 -> B/75, 필수+권장 15건 -> A/86. 패턴 일치.

## 02-act.md 4-Evaluator Review + Reinforcement (2026-02-10)
- **Scores**: 태수 61(C), 연수 73(B), 혜원 68(C), 호진 62(C). Avg=66(C), Range=12pts
- **Inter-rater range**: 12pts (wider than 01-02-chapter 1st eval's 7pt, wider than 01-01-chapter's 3pt). Act docs show more evaluator divergence than Chapter docs.
- **Score by category (avg)**: A=16/25(64%), B=18.5/25(74%), C=12/20(60%), D=8.5/15(57%), E=10/15(67%)
- **B항목 strongest (74%)**, **D항목 weakest (57%)**. D항목 weakness pattern confirmed for ALL doc types.
- **12 common items (3+/4 agreement)**: cave entry motivation, Gyeoul arrival method, 1st Act hook recovery, spatial route, time frame, character growth arc, emotional arc expansion, pacing, stone lantern motif, conflict seeds specifics, villain dynamics, humor elements
- **Reinforcement applied 2026-02-10**: 80->192 lines (240%). All mandatory+recommended items applied.
  - Spatial route (10-step), time frame (6 periods 7pm-9:30pm), growth arc (3 chars), interaction (6 combos)
  - Emotional arc 4->9 stages, pacing with 10 tension-release triggers
  - Reader experience design (hook/anchor/page-turning), humor (5 patterns), age-appropriateness (4 scenes)
  - Foreshadowing (recover 2/install 5/hold 3), unresolved tasks (5 items)
  - "구니스 오마주" removed, "마을회관"->"버려진 마을회관", tone 60:40->65:35 justified
  - Cave entry motivation: enemy footsteps + phosphorescent light. Gyeoul: tracking + rope biting
  - Stone lantern motif: 제단 불꽃 문양 = 석등 꽃받침 문양, Sujin dialogue
- **Notable evaluator insights**: 연수=가장 관대(73/B, 서사축+두루규칙+1막후크 높게), 호진=작가적시각(D항목 가장 엄격 7/15, 감각정보/독자경험 세밀 요구), 혜원=구조적시각(A-3 감정아크 4/4 만점이나 3명은 확장 요구), 태수=가장 엄격(61/C, 종합적)
- **A-3 scoring disagreement**: 혜원 4/4 vs 태수/연수/호진 2-3/4. 혜원은 "감정 그래프가 있으면 OK", 나머지는 "씬별 세분화 필요". 최종: 9단계로 확장.
- **지영/태호 indirect presence (held)**: 연수 제안. 2막은 초등 삼인조+악당 중심, 막 끝 합류로 처리. 중간 간접 등장은 보류.
- **수진 "으악!" 반응 (partially held)**: 호진 제안. 포획 장면은 "떨리는 손"으로 채택, 두루 만남 "으악!"은 Scene에서 결정.
- **두루 존재 규칙**: "사라지는"(원문) -> "활동 불가"(setting-overview 정합). 연수 지적으로 수정.
- **Re-evaluation (태수 2026-02-10 18:00)**: A/88pts. A=22(88%), B=23(92%), C=18(90%), D=13(87%), E=12(80%). +27pts from 61. Chapter creation APPROVED.
- **Remaining for S/90**: (1) "인광 광물" -> setting-overview.md (+1), (2) "구름골" motif in Act 2 (+1)
- **New setting issue**: "인광 광물" not in setting-overview.md. Add to item 17 scope.
- **README inconsistency**: Act 2/3 descriptions outdated. Deferred to after all Acts reach B+.
- **Eval criteria example gap**: criteria example 84/A vs actual avg 66/C. 18pt gap. Version evolution + relative standard issue.

## 03-act.md 4-Evaluator Review + Reinforcement (2026-02-10)
- **Scores**: 태수 48(D), 연수 52(D), 혜원 55(D), 호진 53(D). Avg=52(D), Range=7pts
- **Inter-rater range**: 7pts (tighter than 02-act's 12pts). All 4 evaluators agree on D grade.
- **Score by category (avg)**: A=13.3/25(53%), B=15.3/25(61%), C=8.8/20(44%), D=6.5/15(43%), E=8.3/15(55%)
- **C항목 weakest (44%)**, C항목 40% 미달 flagged by 2 evaluators (연수 35%, 호진 35%). D항목 second weakest (43%).
- **C-4 growth arc = 0/3 all 4 evaluators**. Most critical gap: "갈등과 성장" title but no growth design.
- **Common issues (3+/4 agreement)**: ~15 items all auto-accepted:
  - Spatial route missing, Time frame missing, Growth arc missing, Interaction design missing
  - Humor design missing, Pacing missing, Age-appropriateness missing, Reader experience incomplete
  - Foreshadowing system missing, Villain status missing, Gyeoul status missing
  - 5장 title mismatch ("추격과 탈출" but content is 휴식/합류/논의)
  - 막 title mismatch ("갈등과 성장" vs plot-structure "시련과 성장")
  - Emotion arc insufficient (4 stages), Obstacle mechanisms too vague
- **Reinforcement applied 2026-02-10**: 83->217 lines (261%). ALL 4 evaluators' mandatory+recommended items applied.
  - Title: "갈등과 성장" -> "시련과 성장" (plot-structure alignment)
  - Ch5: "추격과 탈출" -> "합류와 결의", Ch6: "재결합과 결의" -> "시련과 팀워크"
  - Spatial route (11-step), time frame (6 periods 9:30pm-2:30am), growth arc (5 chars)
  - Interactions (6 combos), villain status section, Gyeoul role ("감지자+신호 전달자")
  - Emotional arc 4->9 stages, pacing (장별 + 이완3곳 + 13-step triggers)
  - Humor (6 patterns with dialogue examples), age-appropriateness (5 scenes)
  - Reader experience (hook/anchor/page-turning), foreshadowing (회수3/설치5/유지4)
  - Unresolved tasks (5 items), obstacle mechanisms (2-3 lines each + NOTE-TO-AI)
  - Scene restructuring: 03-06-02 split (was 5 obstacles in 1 scene -> 4 scenes with distributed obstacles)
  - Taeho persuasion 3-step causal chain: (a) 지훈 intuition proven, (b) 지훈 emotional appeal, (c) instinctive grab at vine
- **Notable evaluator insights**: 연수="관계 중심 서사의 인과 설계" (psychological vs event-driven causation), 호진="03-06-02 Scene overload" (5 obstacles in 1 scene unrealistic), 혜원=Ch5 title mismatch (most precise structural finding), 태수=가장 엄격(48/D)
- **Zero rejections**: ALL items from ALL 4 evaluators were accepted. First time in project history.
- **Expected re-eval**: A/85-88pts based on pattern (01-act C->A+27, 02-act C->A+22). Chapter creation approval pending.
- **New plot-structure.md sync needed**: Ch5 "추격과탈출"->"합류와결의", Ch6 "재결합과결의"->"시련과팀워크" changes need plot-structure.md update
